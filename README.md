## Encountering errors!

The user may encounter some errors while running the app, due to the App working fetching images 
from the internet. Because of this, the App is prepared for unexpected errors while fetching, or
no internet connection.

In case of no internet connection, a red banner will be display at the top. It will automatically 
closes once the connection is restored, but the user may close it through the 'Ok. Got it' button

There is a 'Try again' button for re-fetching data
